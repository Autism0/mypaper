As the pretreatment technology of image processing and display, edge-aware filtering methods play an important role in the visual media applications. It needs to filter the detail while preserving the salient structure, which could improve the effect of image visual and could be applied in structure-texture separation. With the deepening of research, how to achieve structure-texture separation of image thoroughly challenge edge-preserving methods, especially various textured images. In order to overcome the limitations of conventional structure-aware filtering in decomposing texture and structure, it need to discover a novel structure-aware decomposition model.

Inspired by the theory of kernel regression, we propose a novel sparsity-guided bilateral kernel regression structure-aware smoothing filter based on local total variation related reductive descriptor. Taking advantage of fast joint bilateral filtering, we present the accelerated form of the bilateral kernel regression filtering, and develop to the structure-aware filtering application. In the experiments, we prove that bilateral kernel regression could remove textures and it is an efficient structure-aware filtering. 

Besides, we propose a novel structure-texture separation method by incorporating the signal remapping function into the rolling guidance framework. Our method inherits the benefits of the efficient framework and effective signal remapping strategy. Our experiments show that our method could remove different scales of texture while preserving salient structure. 

Finally, we describe the applications of the structure-aware. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, we prove that our structure-aware filtering method is efficient.
